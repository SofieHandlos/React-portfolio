        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          I am 23 years old and studying multimedia design in the 3rd semester.
          Besides that, I am working as a student assistant in software
          development at Amero. I am an extremely social person who loves to be
          where something is happening. In addition, I love to travel, which is
          why I spent my sabbatical years after high school travelling around
          Asia and New Zealand, among other places. After studying for a few
          months at the university, where I quickly found out that I don't do a
          lot of self-study and long lectures, I chose to change studies. I
          wanted an everyday life that consisted to a greater extent of group
          work, case-oriented tasks, and creative work, which is why I ended up
          on multimedia design, where there is a particular focus on
          transferring theory to practice.

        <h3>WHAT DO I LIKE TO WORK WITH?</h3>
        <p>
          I am very passionate about programming and UX/UI and participating in
          interdisciplinary work processes in the development of digital user
          interfaces to create a good user experience. In the 3rd semester, I
          chose to specialize in front-end to challenge myself and develop my
          programming skills. I dream of sitting in a position where I both
          collaborate with colleagues who work with UX/UI and focus on the
          structure and structure of a user interface, as well as colleagues who
          develop it. I am very curious about programming and want to strive for
          more knowledge in this field.

        <h3>HOW DO I LIKE TO WORK</h3>
        <p>
          As a person, I am very open/energetic, detail-oriented, and
          well-organized. I have a strong sense of responsibility, regardless of
          whether it is towards my boss, colleagues, or study group, and
          therefore always strive to fulfil obligations. I love working in
          groups where you can inspire each other and collaborate to achieve a
          project well. In group work, I am not afraid to speak my mind and I
          always strive for the best possible result. At the same time, it is
          important to me to help ensure that everyone feels comfortable in the
          group and that everyone feels seen and heard.

        <h3>EXPERIENCES AND COMPENTES </h3>
        <p>
          Through my education and work, I have learned to work professionally
          by developing and implementing digital design and digital user
          experiences that match user needs. In addition, I have gained
          knowledge in test methods such as think aloud, gangster test and open
          and closed card sorting have ensured optimized navigation and general
          usability. Furthermore, I have developed my skills in programming with
          more knowledge about, among other things, React, fetching, and data
          sources. I look forward to expanding my current skills even more.
